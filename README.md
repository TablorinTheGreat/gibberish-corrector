# gibberish-corrector
Isn't it annoying when you type for a few minutes and then you realize you were typing in the wrong language? Well I developed a python tool that checks your typing and using an English dictionary and a Hebrew dictionary it can check if you are typing in the wrong language and can delete, correct and change the language for you.

### problems
It is difficult to handle words that aren't in the dictionary like names of companies etc.

Currently it checks words in blocks of 3 so it can cause a number of problems.

Since this is an old project I mainly did for fun I do not intend to continue working on it unless it will get a lot of interest.
